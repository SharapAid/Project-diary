The personal-diary project is designed for use as a shift-changing program. It works on a database and has a structure for registering and logging in a user, checking passwords and names, and also by logging into your account you can change your name and password, delete your entire profile.Since this is a personal diary, it implements recording and reading data through a database. At the moment, there is no data selection, but in the future it will most likely be added. The program only works on the terminal, and to run it, you will need to compile all .cpp files (It is important that you cannot compile without an installed database), use the flags -lsqlite3.
